# Practicals Extreme Value Statistics - ATHENS

## Introduction
You will find in this `renkulab` project all practicals and the material necessary for the course's project.

For the latter, you need to form pairs and send an email to `raphael.defondeville[at]bfs.admin.ch` with your names and the physical quantity you want to analyze:
- Wind speed,
- Rainfall,
- Temperature.
More details about the data can be found in the Data section.

## Project instructions:
- Load your database, which depends on the number of your group;
- Explore your database (descriptive statistics), following the example given in `NO2.Rmd`:
    - Do not hesitate to go further than in NO2.Rmd (e.g. plot histograms, spot anomalies, remove trends, etc.),
    - This exploratory analysis should help you assess if your data satisfies the classical assumptions in Extreme Value Theory (e.g. stationarity, mixing, existence of a maximum domain of attraction, etc.),
- Perform a full univariate extreme value analysis for the variable and locations you were assigned:
    - Both block-maxima and peaks-over-threshold can be considered.
    - Is there a maximum domain of attraction ? Is the variable heavy-tailed ?
    - Estimate the EVI, deduce extreme probabilities and extreme quantiles
- Try to interpret your results. 
- Intiatives going beyond the `NO2.Rmd` example, such as multivariate modelling and / or spatial analysis will be expected.

If you do not know what to conclude from your results, you can try to see what classical distributions would give: simulate artificial data sets from a GEV/GPD (choose the parameters wisely), and see what the resulting statistics would look like...

## Data and code
We propose three different data sets:
- Rainfall station measurements in the state of Victoria, AU;
- Wind speed over western Europe;
- Temperature measurements in the South of France.

The provided data file entitled `team_number.RData`, include three objects:
- `dataset`: data frame including the measurements from five locations;
- `dates`:dates for each row of the data.frame;
- `coordinates`: geographical coordinates for each of the locations.

You can find the corresponding code to display the location of your measurements inthe folder `Code_Example`.

For a block maxima analysis, you will need to first define, e.g., yearly maxima, and compute blocks from the original data. 

## Deadline and grading
The project is be due on Sunday, April 24th, 2022, at 23:59 CET (UTC+1). To hand-out the project, simply send by email to `hans.wackernagel[at]mines-paristech.fr` the link of the renkulab project containing your report.

We will dowload the souce code and corresponding rendered htlm/pdf file that will be used to grade the project.
